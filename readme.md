# Built With Jigsaw

Sites built with Jigsaw.

## How to add a site
- [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
- [Clone your fork locally](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Run `./addsite.sh` in the root project directory
- Add a screenshot of your site to `source/assets/images/sites/<your-site-name>.png`, using the same base file name as the markdown file generated by `addsite.sh`. E.g. if your resulting markdown file is `my-site.md`, name your screenshot file `my-site.png`. This file should be 380x210px, PNG-8 not PNG-24, and run through an image optimizer like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac)
- Install dependencies with `composer install && npm install`. Then `npm run dev` and `vendor/bin/jigsaw serve` in other terminal, so you can preview your changes locally in `http://localhost:8000`
- Commit your changes (and only your changes; this should comprise of two added files), and push to your fork
- [Submit a PR against this repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
